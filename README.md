This is my work for the Object drills in the 
'Learn Your Dev Environment' section from Thinkful. 

I completed everything up until the bonus questions.
I suspect I need to utilize the 'find' method but I have not 
figured it out yet. 

I hope I will have time to return to complete the bonus questions, 
as finding things in datasets is extremely important and I would 
like to learn how to do it.
